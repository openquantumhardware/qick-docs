The Quantum Instrumentation Control Kit (QICK for short) is a Xilinx RFSoC-based qubit controller which supports the direct synthesis of control pulses with carrier frequencies of up to 6 GHz. The QICK consists of a digital board hosting an RFSoC (RF System-on-Chip) FPGA, custom firmware and software, and an optional companion custom-designed analog front-end board. All of the schematics, firmware, and software are open-source and available on `Github <https://github.com/openquantumhardware/qick>`_.

Getting started with QICK
########

   * First, for a global overview of the QICK and its capabilities, read `our technical paper introducing the QICK <https://www.arxiv.org>`_.

   * If you have a ZCU111 board and you want to configure it as a QICK board, follow `the quick start guide on our Github repository <https://github.com/openquantumhardware/qick/tree/main/quick_start>`_.

   * After you configure your board, you can test it with `our library of loopback demos <https://github.com/openquantumhardware/qick/tree/main/qick_demos>`_.

   * The source code for the QICK software library is available `at this link <https://github.com/openquantumhardware/qick/tree/main/qick_lib>`_. To learn more about the QICK software, see the following documentation.

QICK firmware
########

   * If you are interested in learning more about the QICK firmware, the firmware and its documentation are available `here <https://github.com/openquantumhardware/qick/tree/main/firmware>`_.

   * You also may want to learn more about how the QICK tProcessor works. In this case, you can reference the `QICK assembly language documentation <https://github.com/openquantumhardware/qick/blob/main/firmware/tProcessor_64_and_Signal_Generator_V4.pdf>`_. Note that this documentation may not be up to date with the current version of the QICK firmware. It is made available here as a learning tool for those interested in learning the principles of the QICK tProcessor. Those who have more specific questions can contact ``lstefana AT fnal.gov``.
