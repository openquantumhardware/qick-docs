QICK software cheat sheet
=================================================

Python calls
########

``soc.tproc.single_write(addr=imm, data=variable)`` writes the value ``variable`` to the data memory ``imm``

ASM_Program calls
########

``p.memri(p, r, imm, 'comment')`` -- read the data memory at the address specified by ``imm`` and write the result into page ``p``, register ``r``.

``p.regwi(p,r,value)``  -- write the ``value`` to page ``p``, register ``r``.

``p.bitwi(p, rDst, rSrc, operation, value)`` -- performs the bitwise ``operation`` on the contents of page ``p``, register ``rSrc`` and ``value`` and write the result in page ``p``, register ``rDst``.  ``rSrc`` and ``rDst`` may be the same or register.

``p.bitw(p, rDst, rSrc1, operation, rSrc2`` -- performs the bitwise ``operation`` on two source registers (``rSrc1`` and ``rSrc2``) and put the result in the destination register ``rDst``, where all three registers are on the same page ``p``.

``p.seti(channel, p, rSrc, time)`` -- take the value at page ``p``, register ``rSrc`` and send it to ``channel`` that the specifified ``time``.

``p.label(labelName)`` -- mark this location in the program, for use by the ``loopz`` and ``condj`` commands.

``p.set(channel, p, ra, rb,rc,rd,re,time)`` -- sent the values on page ``p`` registers ``ra``, ``rb``, ``rc``, ``rd``, ``re`` to ``channel`` at ``time``. The registers ``ra`` through ``re`` contain, in order, 16-bit values of frequency, phase, address, gain, and (nsamp,outsel, mode, stdysel)

``p.sync(p,r)`` -- synchronize internal time offset to the value specified by page ``p``,register ``r``

``p.synci(p,timeOffset)`` -- synchronize internal time offset by ``timeOffset``

ASM_Program bitwise operations
########

* ``<<`` -- shift bits left by ``value`` bits, ignores ``rSrc``
* ``|`` -- or
* ``&`` -- and
* ``^`` -- exclusive or
* ``~`` -- not ``value``, ignores ``rSrc``

tProcessor register information
########

The tproc contains 8 pages of 32 registers each, making 256 registers in total. Each register is 32 bits wide.

Signal generator options
########

Use ``stdysel`` to select what value is output continuously by the signal generator after the generation of a pulse.

* 0: the last calculated sample of the pulse
* 1: a zero value

Use ``mode`` to select whether the output is periodic or one-shot.  Here is what happens after generating the specified number of samples.  Look in the queue to see if there is a new waveform to generate.  If there is a new waveform in the queue, remove it from the queue and generate it.  If there is not, use the value of ``mode`` to decide what to do.

* 0:  stop
* 1:  generate the current waveform

Then continue looking for a new waveform.

Use ``outsel`` to select the output source.  The output is complex.  Tables define envelopes for I and Q.

* 0:  product of table and DDS
* 1:  DDS
* 2:  from the table for the real part, and zeros for the imaginary part
* 3:  always zero
